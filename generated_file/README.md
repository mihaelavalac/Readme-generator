  ## Description 

  <p><i>The Butterflies Hunting is a game based on JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, and HTML. The main motivation behind this project was to practice my freshly gained jQuery knowledges. The idea of the game is that whenever a user clicks on a butterfly, he/she receives one point. Through this project I also learned how to integrate jQuery UI features and how to modify their style. </i><p>
